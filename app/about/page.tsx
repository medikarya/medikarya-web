                            Aviation has flight simulators. Surgery has procedure labs. But for most clinical reasoning decisions — the ones that determine diagnoses, investigations, and management — medical students have only textbooks and hope. MediKarya is trying to change that.

                                    Medical students in India spend years learning anatomy, physiology, and pathology. Then they step into a ward and are expected to translate all of that into real-time clinical decisions — often with minimal supervision, on patients they've never seen before.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The supervised bedside learning that used to fill this gap is shrinking. Patient loads are high, attending time is limited, and students observe more than they do. The consequence isn't just slower skill development — it's clinical decisions made with incomplete confidence.
                                </p>

                                    We believe a structured simulation environment, built around realistic Indian clinical cases, can change this. Not by replacing clinical experience — but by preparing students to use it better.

                            MediKarya is an AI patient simulation platform. Students interact with a virtual patient presented with a chief complaint. They take a history, order investigations, interpret results, and submit a diagnosis and management plan. The AI evaluates their reasoning at each step — not just whether the final diagnosis was right, but whether the clinical thinking was sound.
                        </p>

                            Cases are built around real clinical presentations — the kinds seen at district hospitals and tertiary centres across India. Paediatrics, obstetrics, neurology, medicine. Each case comes with evidence-based learning objectives, structured differentials, and teaching points grounded in current guidelines.
